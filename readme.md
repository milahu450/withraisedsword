# With raised sword

Idiots end their letters "with friendly greeting". But only enemies have to be "friendly", real friends write "Your friend". So shit on this lying crap, I end my letters "with raised sword â¸¸".

"Raised sword" means: Who stands in our way, we kill him. Middle finger. We are: Living gods, executioners, masters over life and death, Satanists, Antichrists, soldiers, serial killers, ... We take life serious, dead serious. We don't have a "second life after death".
